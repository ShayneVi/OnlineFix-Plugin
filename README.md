4. **Steam Client** (obviously!)

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Extract the `onlinefix` folder to your Millennium plugins directory:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\plugins

---

## üìñ How to Use

### Applying a Fix

1. Open your Steam library
2. Navigate to any supported game's detail page
3. Look for the **FIX** button next to the settings/manage buttons
4. Click the **FIX** button
5. The plugin will:
   - Verify the game is installed
   - Download the fix from the repository
   - Extract files to the game directory
   - Show a success notification


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The plugin can be configured via the `config.json` file located in the plugin directory.

### Configuration Options

```json
{
    "show_button": true
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `show_button` | boolean | `true` | Show/hide the FIX button globally |

### Supported Games

The plugin uses `appIDs.txt` to determine which games should show the FIX button. The file contains over 1,000 Steam AppIDs for games with available fixes.

**To add more games:**
 Replace appIDs.txt with the latest on my github.

**To disable filtering** (show button for all games):
- Delete or rename `appIDs.txt`
- The button will appear for all games (though fixes may not exist)

```

### Backend Functions

The Python backend provides several key functions:

- **Game Detection**: Finds Steam library folders and game install paths
- **Fix Download**: Downloads fixes from the GitHub repository
- **File Extraction**: Extracts and copies files to game directories
- **Notifications**: Shows Windows toast notifications
- **AppID Filtering**: Determines which games should show the fix button

### Frontend Integration

The TypeScript frontend:
- Injects a custom button into Steam's library interface
- Communicates with the Python backend via Millennium's IPC
- Provides visual feedback during operations
- Handles button positioning and styling
